    "As a lecturer I might pick the real-world phenomenon of the performance of students studying a ten-credit module. After some research, I decide that the most interesting variable related to this is the mark a student receives in the module - this is going to be one of my variables (grade).Upon investigation of the problem, I find that the number of hours on average astudent studies per week (hours), the number of times they log onto Moodle in the first three weeks of term (logins), and their previous level of degree qualification (qual) are closely related to grade.
